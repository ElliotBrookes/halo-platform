# halo-platform
Platform to facilitate non-profit organisations donations and other tech needs all grouped into one place/ platform to incentivise support

Initial thoughts:

- Current plan is to make a simple payment platform initially that works with multiple payment providers and apis to bundle transactions with statements and distribute to relevant parties.
- Paymnet types that can be supported will be based off of the payment provider that the non-profits use to facilitate payments, support large and small individual payments as well as direct debits.
- Must be able to integrate simply and quickly with new organisations
- Must be maleable to fit into whatever tech structure or architectures they are already using both tech wise and business wise.
- Will only cover costs of development and running costs as commissions, these will be decided at the beginning of every tax year, though will be scaffolded beforehand. In theory this would make sure that the platform would be non-profit as well (otherwise whats the point)
- Must be able to store, handle and manage users information properly and securely without a chance of leaking information even remotely (Note new Quantum resistance in the e2e encryption space, could be worth looking into).
- Must have ways for providing outreach and navigation to payments should be optimised for as few pain points as possible
- HMust have features that will incentivise the use of the platform (Could be done by having leaderboards for payments, or have point values that can increase based on verified volunteer work etc.)
- The incentives must be incentives due to social standing probably, in terms of making it integrate seamlessly with professional websites like LinkedIn and Github, Indeed and Reed as well as the major social media platforms.
